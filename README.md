# React Native FlatList Intermittent Empty List Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native intermittently renders an empty list despite successfully fetching data from an API.  The issue is sporadic and doesn't consistently reproduce, making debugging challenging.

## Problem Description

The `DataList` component fetches data from a remote API using `fetch`. While the API call is successful and returns valid JSON, the FlatList sometimes fails to render the fetched data, displaying an empty list instead.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app using a React Native emulator or device.
4. Observe the FlatList.  The list might be empty, even though the API call is successful (check your network tab in the developer tools to verify successful API response).

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the data state update happens correctly, which may require careful handling of the state update process.
The solution provided in `DataListSolution.js` addresses this by making sure the data is rendered only when it is not null and not an empty array.
